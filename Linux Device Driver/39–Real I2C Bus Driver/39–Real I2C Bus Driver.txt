Introduction
In our last tutorial, we have seen how to write the dummy I2C bus driver in the Linux kernel. It doesn’t send any data to 
the Salve device. So in this tutorial, we have come up with the real I2C bus Linux device driver. Using this I2C bus driver, 
we can send data to the slave device. Let’s start.

We have discussed the APIs too in the last tutorials. In this tutorial, we just used a new API called i2c_add_numbered_adapter(). 
This API will allocate the bus number that we are asking if that is available. In the last tutorial, we have not used this. 
Instead, we used i2c_add_adapter(). This API will allocate the bus number dynamically.
